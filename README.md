TimeCardStomp
========
This code is an arduino project to have a physical time tracking device. The goal is to build a server component to make interacting with the device more user-friendly, but at the moment communication is done through the serial port.

In order to add projects (up to five), use the following syntax:
	syncProject@1|Project 1@2|Project 2@

At that point, you can use buttons 1 and 2 to clock in/out and switch between projects.

In order to clear out any time use the following command:
	timeWipe@ 

Enjoy!
